This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the version of Expo CLI installed locally and the version specified or required by your project's package.json file.  It can also happen if there are conflicting dependencies or corrupted installation files.  The error message itself may not be very specific, which makes debugging challenging.

Example Scenario (inconsistent package.json and installed expo-cli):

Your package.json specifies:
```json
{"dependencies": {
  "expo": "^47.0.12"
}}
```

But you have Expo CLI v48 installed globally.  Expo will try to resolve these versions and will fail to properly set up the environment if there is a mismatch.
