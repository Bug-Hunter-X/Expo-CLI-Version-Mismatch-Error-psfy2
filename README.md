# Expo CLI Version Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common but often difficult-to-diagnose error in Expo CLI: a mismatch between the expected Expo CLI version (as declared in `package.json`) and the actual globally installed version. This leads to build and start failures, often presenting cryptic error messages.

## Problem

The project's `package.json` may specify a particular version or version range for `expo`, but the globally installed Expo CLI version differs. This inconsistency can prevent Expo from properly configuring the project's development environment and result in various errors during the build or start processes.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the globally installed Expo CLI version aligns with or satisfies the version constraints specified in your project's `package.json` file.  This might involve upgrading or downgrading the Expo CLI.
