The most reliable solution is to ensure consistent Expo CLI versions. Here's how:

1. **Check your `package.json`:**  Examine the `dependencies` section in your `package.json` to identify the version of `expo` required by your project.

2. **Check your globally installed Expo CLI version:** Open your terminal and run `expo --version` to see your currently installed version.

3. **Match the versions:** If there's a mismatch, update your global Expo CLI installation using npm or yarn to match your `package.json` version. For example, if your `package.json` requires `expo@^47.0.12`, and you have Expo v48 installed, use:

```bash
npm install -g expo@47.0.12
```

Or if you want to update to the latest version, run:

```bash
npm install -g expo
```

4. **Clear the cache (if needed):** Sometimes, a cached Expo installation can cause issues. Try clearing the Expo cache:

```bash
expo start --clear
```

5. **Verify the installation:** After updating or clearing the cache, try running `expo start` again. The build process should complete without the version mismatch error. If problems persist, check for other conflicting dependencies using `npm ls` or `yarn why`.
